# Radio Buttons Lab
## Problem Statement
In this lab, you will create a set of radio buttons with labels inside a form. Radio buttons are used when you want the user to select one option among a group.

Initially, create three radio buttons with labels of your choice, make sure that the input elements contain the ID's `option1`, `option2` & `option3` respectively.

Then, group them under the same name and disable the third radio button. Pre-select the second radio button by default, and finally wrap the form in a div with id 'wrapper'.

## Challenges
✅ Create three radio buttons with labels in the form.

✅ Group the radio buttons, so that only one option can be selected

✅ Disable the third radio button having id = `option3`

✅ Pre-select the second radio button by default having the id = `option2`

✅ Wrap the form in a div with id *wrapper*.
