# Semantic HTML Structure

## Problem Statement

Welcome to HTML Basic Semantic Layout Lab.

In this lab, you'll create a very simple html page layout that would contain four semantic html elements.

You would have to create a simple `header` , `nav`, `main` and `footer` elements with proper unordered list of links in the `nav` element using `a` tag for the links.

This challenge is focused on helping you understand the basic layout of any website that is created. Take a look at the challenges, for clear break down of tasks that you have to accomplish in this lab.

> `This lab has pre-written css styles in place, if you start writing the correct markup, you should see a simple background colors being applied for each different semantic element.`



## Challenges
