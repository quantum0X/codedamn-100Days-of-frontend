# Fieldset Tag Lab

## Problem statement
In this lab, you will practice creating a simple form using the `fieldset` and `legend` elements to organize the input fields.

A fieldset element is used to group related elements in a form, while the legend element provides a caption for the fieldset. This enhances the accessibility and organization of the form.

Fieldset works by wrapping around the form elements you want to group, and the legend element is placed inside the fieldset, acting as the label.

You are required to create a form with a fieldset containing input elements for `username` and `email` each with corresponding labels.

## Challenges
✅ Create a form tag with id `form` and a `fieldset` inside the form tag.

✅ Inside the `fieldset`, create a legend tag with the text `User Information`

✅ Add an input element of type `text` with the id `username` and a label `Username` for the input element, make sure to link the label to the input using the `for` attribute

✅ Add an input element of type `email` with the id `email` and a label `Email` for the input element, make sure to link the label to the input using the `for` attribute
